I'm {{ site.first_name }} {{ site.last_name }}, a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/" target="_blank">DTAI</a> research group at <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/" target="_blank">KU Leuven</a>. My main research interest lies in neural-symbolic integration (NeSy), more specifically the integration of neural networks and probabilistic logic programming.

# Projects
I've been involved in the following projects:

### [DeepLog](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/cs/onderzoek/deeplog)
DeepLog is a foundational NeSy project exploring the integration of neural networks with logical and probabilistic reasoning. It aims to shift the paradigm by defining core primitives that unify logical, probabilistic, and neural representations. It will be an open-source Python software package for implementing and evaluating a broad range of NeSy systems and applications.

### [iBOF: Automating Data Science: the Next Frontiers](https://research.kuleuven.be/portal/en/project/3E210057)
I had a minor adivsory role on a project on fairness and mitigating bias using Probabilistic Logic Programming.

### [Flanders AI Research](https://www.flandersairesearch.be/en)
I was involved as a PostDoc on a project related to *Decision Support for the Low Voltage Grid*.

### [TAILOR](https://tailor-network.eu/)
I was involved as a PostDoc to help with managing Work Package 4 on *Unifying Paradigms*. I was involved in organizing workshops and writing some of the final deliverables.

### [Synth](https://synth.cs.kuleuven.be/)
I was briefly involved in the Synth project at the start of my PhD, but moved on to my personal FWO funding afterwards.
